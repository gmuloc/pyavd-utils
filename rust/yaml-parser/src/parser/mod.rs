//! Event-to-AST parser.
//!
//! This module implements the `Parser` that consumes events emitted by the
//! YAML emitter and builds the AST (`Node` / `Value`).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Lexer -> Emitter (Event stream) -> Parser -> AST
//! ```
//!
//! The `Parser` is much simpler than a token-based parser because
//! structural detection (indentation, flow/block contexts) is handled by the
//! `Emitter`. The `Parser` just needs to:
//! 1. Match start/end event pairs (mapping, sequence, document)
//! 2. Resolve scalars using the shared YAML 1.2 Core-schema resolver
//! 3. Track anchors for alias validation
#![allow(
    clippy::multiple_inherent_impl,
    reason = "the parser is intentionally split across multiple files without changing the owning type"
)]
